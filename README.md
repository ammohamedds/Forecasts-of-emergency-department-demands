# Forecasts-of-emergency-department-demands
Project aims to predict the emergency department attendances of patients in rural hospitals of Queensland.
Developed a project for government by building Website to automatically retrieve rural emergency department data from the Queensland government, visualize the historical data, implementing ML algorithms (SARIMA) to provide short-term and long-term forecasts of emergency department demands and anticipate the expected number of patients (https://www.healthqld.com).

The data sets were achieved from Queensland government in the open data portal and can be
accessed at https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/rural-emergency-departments.
